Game files for the Roblox game "Cosmic Pursuit"

//Game Description
Cosmic Pursuit is an open-world, outer space themed adventure game created on ROBLOX.com

Set in a vast solar system which hosts a plethora of different planets, space stations, and asteroids, the game features elements of free roam exploration, team-based cooperative combat, resource management, role-play, and sandbox style construction.

In addition to travel with personal spaceships, the game features a principal transport mechanic based on the titular technology of the "Stargate" sci-fi franchise. Each planet and station have its own Stargate device, and any two of these can be connected together in order to establish a temporary wormhole for quick travel from one area to another.
